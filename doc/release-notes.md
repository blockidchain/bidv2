Mandatory Update
==============


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/blockidcoin-Qt (on Mac) or blockidcoind/blockidcoin-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

blockidcoin is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Apple released it's last Mountain Lion update August 13, 2015, and officially ended support on [December 14, 2015](http://news.fnal.gov/2015/10/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-10-8-end-of-life-december-14/). blockidcoin software starting with v3.2.0 will no longer run on MacOS versions prior to Yosemite (10.10). Please do not report issues about MacOS versions prior to Yosemite to the issue tracker.

blockidcoin should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.

### RPC/REST

New network upgrades output
---------------------------

A new return field 'upgrades' was added to the `getblockchaininfo` RPC method.
Showing the upcoming and active upgrades. Starting with blockidcoin v5.0.0 Purple Fenix
network upgrade.


Asm representations of scriptSig signatures now contain SIGHASH type decodes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `asm` property of each scriptSig now contains the decoded signature hash
type for each signature that provides a valid defined hash type.

The following items contain assembly representations of scriptSig signatures
and are affected by this change:

- RPC `getrawtransaction`
- RPC `decoderawtransaction`
- REST `/rest/tx/` (JSON format)
- REST `/rest/block/` (JSON format when including extended tx details)
- `bitcoin-tx -json`

For example, the `scriptSig.asm` property of a transaction input that
previously showed an assembly representation of:

    304502207fa7a6d1e0ee81132a269ad84e68d695483745cde8b541e3bf630749894e342a022100c1f7ab20e13e22fb95281a870f3dcf38d782e53023ee313d741ad0cfbc0c509001

now shows as:

    304502207fa7a6d1e0ee81132a269ad84e68d695483745cde8b541e3bf630749894e342a022100c1f7ab20e13e22fb95281a870f3dcf38d782e53023ee313d741ad0cfbc0c5090[ALL]

Note that the output of the RPC `decodescript` did not change because it is
configured specifically to process scriptPubKey and not scriptSig scripts.
